## How To Use

The folder called Testing shows the base functionaloity of the STM32 that we have
Please use this as a reference for any future code you wish to do. 

If you want to work in it, that is okay, but do not destroy what is currently in the code, only add to it.
Eventually, the testing code will be cleaned up and a second folder called MASTER will be pushed.
